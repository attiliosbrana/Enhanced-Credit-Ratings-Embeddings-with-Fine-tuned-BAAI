Moody's downgrades Paramount Global's senior unsecured ratings to Baa3 and short-term rating to P-3; outlook negative
New York, August 31, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) downgraded Paramount Global's (Paramount) ratings, including its senior unsecured debt ratings to Baa3 from Baa2, its junior subordinate debt ratings to Ba1 from Baa3 and its short-term commercial paper rating to Prime-3 from Prime-2. This action concludes the review for downgrade initiated on 24 August 2023. The outlook was changed to negative.
The downgrade and negative outlook reflect Paramount's high financial leverage which was about 6.0x (including Moody's adjustments) as of the LTM period June 30th, 2023 and Moody's expectation that despite improving profitability, financial leverage will remain above 4x by the end of 2025. The high leverage reflects the combined effect of investing in direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming resulting in startup losses, and secular pressure on the company's linear television operations. Both social and governance factors are key considerations for the rating action. Paramount's exposure to social risks, particularly secular societal trends reflecting the ongoing transition to direct-to-consumer television, and its exposure to governance risks, such as management's risk strategies regarding mitigation of the medium-term effects of the transition, are material.

RATINGS RATIONALE
Paramount has been experiencing the effects of the transition from linear television distribution to DTC streaming distribution. This has put the company in a heavy multi-year investment period that has also occurred among the company's sector peers. While Moody's views such investment as appropriate and the pivot existential, the result has clearly increased risk due to declining linear revenues as growth in DTC streaming has yet to reach sufficient scale and maturity to generate margins similar to the linear business. The company's streaming platforms have been among the fastest growing in the US over the last two years, though strategies remain fluid in important international markets which are important to reaching scale. There may be opportunities to significantly improve DTC economics in international markets through continued evolution of the distribution strategy.
The company has thus far partially mitigated some of the effects on credit metrics with significant debt reduction from equity raises (common and hybrid), and non-core asset sales totaling around $8 billion, and also has recently substantially cut its dividend (by 80%) to preserve capital.  Moody's believes that the company has passed peak losses in DTC and will start to show sequential improvement in margins and EBITDA despite continuing erosion in the company's linear operations. Moody's expects consolidation of Paramount+ and Showtime OTT to result in a more competitive unified platform, providing a stronger customer value proposition and a solid opportunity for content and other cost savings. Moody's also believes that the company's implemented subscriber price increase will substantially improve performance and do not anticipate material lasting customer push back beyond a temporary slowdown in net additions. However, even with those opportunities, Moody's forecasts leverage to be between 4.2x and 4.6x (including Moody's adjustments) by the end of 2025 even with the expected net addition growth and assuming no extra measures are taken, which would still position the company weakly in the Baa3 rating category. The company continues to explore options to accelerate an improvement in credit metrics to a level more consistent with the Baa3 rating but those efforts are not sufficiently developed to incorporate into forecasts and ratings analysis. Moody's has concerns as indicated by the negative outlook,  that further options by the company to accelerate such improvement in credit metrics to a level more consistent with the Baa3 rating have narrowed or have become less attractive and therefore diminishing the probability that it will execute any of these options.
Paramount's ratings continue to be supported by its leadership positions in the television media and film industries as indicated by its sizeable revenue and its large, diverse and valuable asset base and iconic brands in each of its segments.
The negative outlook reflects uncertainty about the company's ability to improve credit metrics to a level that is consistent with the Baa3 unsecured rating over the next two years. An extended deleveraging period creates greater uncertainty that management can achieve all of their goals, particularly in international markets, and greater risk that the linear business decline accelerates before the streaming business can generate free cash flows to reduce debt sufficiently to mitigate the impact on credit metrics.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
Given the negative outlook, an upgrade of the ratings is unlikely over the near term. Over the medium term, the ratings could be upgraded with strong subscriber, revenue and profitability growth and leverage (Moody's adjusted) sustained under 3.25x, with free cash flow-to-debt (Moody's adjusted) above 15%. A positive rating action could also be conditional on management sustaining a significantly more conservative financial policy. The outlook could be stabilized if the company continues to find success in subscriber growth, particularly in large international markets, and can grow its content investments competitively to sustain such growth while at the same time improving margins and credit metrics such that leverage can be reduced and sustained at or under 4.0x (including Moody's adjustments) despite linear pressures.
The ratings could be downgraded if leverage is sustained well above 4.0x (including Moody's adjustments) or margins fail to expand due to an increasing rate of linear decline not met with increasing rate of streaming profitability improvement.
