Moody's revises outlook to negative on East Ramapo CSD, NY; affirms Baa3 issuer and GOULT ratings
New York, August 22, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the Baa3 issuer rating and Baa3 general obligation unlimited tax (GOULT) bond rating on East Ramapo Central School District, NY. The outlook has been revised to negative from stable. The district has approximately $48 million in GOULT bonds outstanding.
RATINGS RATIONALE
The Baa3 issuer rating reflects the district's very weak governance which has resulted in a narrow financial position severely limiting financial flexibility. The district has a trend of structurally unbalanced budgets reliant on cash flow borrowing and more recently increased state and federal funding. Despite recent stability supported by an influx of federal money and large increase in state aid, the financial position is expected to deteriorate over the next three years absent additional increases in recurring revenue. The rating also incorporates below-average resident income, a positive enrollment trend despite enrolling less than 30% of school age district residents, above-average leverage driven by unfunded pension and OPEB liabilities and a large amount of deferred maintenance across the district which will require significant capital investment.
Environmental, social and governance risks are key drivers to the rating. District governance is considered weak because of the inability of the school board to provide adequate resources for students despite the state monitors powers and efforts to adhere to a long-term strategic fiscal and academic plan. The weak governance also impacts the district's ability to effectively manage a challenging social and demographic profile. Social challenges include a low graduation rate, very high dropout rates, high percentage of English as a second language students, and a high poverty rate compared to the state average for school districts. The environment risk is material given the district's building condition survey results that rates all 13 schools as either failing or unsatisfactory including a growing health concern over the lack of water outlets. While the district's water supply is safe, the school buildings poor water infrastructure does not allow students and staff access to the water supply.
The Baa3 GOULT rating is the same as the issuer rating based on the district's pledge of its faith and credit, a security feature of all general obligation debt issued by school districts in New York.
RATING OUTLOOK
The negative outlook reflects the historical lack of support for property tax increases and the likelihood of financial deterioration of the already narrow reserves and liquidity beginning in fiscal 2026 absent an increase in property tax revenue or another recurring revenue source. The outlook also reflects the recent results from the district's 2022 building condition surveys that rated all school buildings as either failing or unsatisfactory. The estimated cost to address the capital needs is $236 million. The condition and safety concerns of the district infrastructure could further challenge the district's operations and academic programs.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS
- A trend of structurally balanced operations
- Material increase in available reserves and liquidity
- Further state oversight including increased powers of the state monitors, funding towards capital or operating costs
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
- Decline in available reserves and liquidity
- Failure to address the long-term structural imbalance
- Adoption of a contingency budget for fiscal 2025
- Inability to maintain academic programs as a result of failing infrastructure
LEGAL SECURITY
District bonds are supported by the district's full faith and credit backed by the district's authority to levy ad valorem taxes on real property within the district without limit as to rate or amount. The bonds are further supported by the State of New York's commitment to advance available state aid to pay debt service pursuant to the state's Section 99-b intercept program.
