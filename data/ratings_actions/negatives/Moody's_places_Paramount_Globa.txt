Moody's places Paramount Global's Baa2 senior unsecured ratings and its P-2 Commercial Paper rating on review for downgrade
New York, August 24, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) placed Paramount Global's (Paramount) ratings, including its Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, Baa3 junior subordinate debt ratings and Prime-2 short-term commercial paper rating, on review for downgrade.        
The review is prompted by Paramount's high financial leverage and the risk that it will not be able to improve credit metrics to a level that is consistent with the Baa2 ratings by the end of 2025 given the combined effect of streaming losses and secular pressure on the company's linear television operations. A downgrade would likely be limited to one notch in each class of debt. Both social and governance are key considerations for the ratings review. Paramount's exposure to Social risks, particularly secular societal trends in most of its businesses and its ongoing transition to direct-to-consumer television are impacting results, and its exposure to Governance risks, such as management's risk strategies regarding mitigation of the medium-term effects of the transition are material.

RATINGS RATIONALE / FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
Paramount has been experiencing the effects of the transition from linear television distribution to direct-to-consumer (DTC) steaming distribution. This has put the company in a heavy multi-year investment period that has also occurred among the company's sector peers. While Moody's views such investment as appropriate and the pivot existential, the result has clearly increased risk due to declining linear revenues as growth in DTC streaming have yet to reach sufficient scale and maturity to generate margins similar to the linear business. Strategies remain fluid , particularly in international markets. There may be opportunities to significantly improve DTC economics in international markets through continued evolution of the distribution strategy. The company has thus far partially mitigated some of the effects on credit metrics with significant debt reduction from equity raises (common and hybrid), non-core asset sales and a substantial dividend cut. The review will focus on the potential, if any, for further options by management to improve credit metrics to a level more consistent with the Baa2 ratings and the probability that they will execute any of these options. This will be against the backdrop of Moody's expectation that company has passed peak losses in DTC and will start to show sequential improvement in profitability despite continuing erosion for the company's linear operations.
