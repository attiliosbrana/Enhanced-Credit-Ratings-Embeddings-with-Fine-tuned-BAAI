Fitch Downgrades Risland (Thailand)'s Guaranteed Debentures to 'B-(tha)'

Fitch Ratings - Bangkok - 08 Aug 2023: Fitch Ratings (Thailand) has downgraded the National Long-Term Ratings on the guaranteed debentures of Risland (Thailand) Company Limited (RLT) to 'B-(tha)', from 'BBB+(tha)'.
The debentures are guaranteed by China-based Country Garden Holdings Company Limited (CGH) and the rating is based entirely on our assessment of CGH's credit profile. The downgrade reflects our view that CGH's credit profile has weakened significantly.
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The rating on the guaranteed debentures reflect the credit enhancement provided to investors by the full, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by the parent, CGH. The guarantee ranks at least pari passu with CGH's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
The deterioration of CGH's credit profile reflects weakening contracted sales and rising refinancing risk on capital-market debt maturities.
DERIVATION SUMMARY
The rating on the guaranteed debentures is based entirely on the credit profile of the guarantor, CGH, a leading homebuilder in China, with one of the most well-diversified land banks among peers. We believe CGH's credit profile has deteriorated due to a decline in contracted sales and weaker liquidity.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:
- Strengthening of CGH's credit profile
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:
- A weakening of CGH's credit profile
ISSUER PROFILE
