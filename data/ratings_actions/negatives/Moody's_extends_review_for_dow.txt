Moody's extends review for downgrade of Tianjin Rail Transit's rating
Hong Kong, August 24, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has extended its review for downgrade of Tianjin Rail Transit Group Co., Ltd.'s (TRT) A3 issuer rating.  
The review extension follows the review for downgrade that was initiated on 1 June 2023, primarily due to Tianjin's weakening fundamentals and challenging liquidity conditions associated with its contingent liabilities that would require substantial debt resolution measures to resolve. The extension reflects Moody's rising expectations that government support measures will be forthcoming, although uncertainties remain around how and whether these measures will materially strengthen the Tianjin government's capacity to provide support.              
RATINGS RATIONALE
Moody's is extending its review of TRT's ratings to reflect its expectation that government support measures to address the liquidity challenges facing Tianjin's local government financing vehicles (LGFVs) will be forthcoming and could have material implication on the Tianjin government's credit condition. An extended observation period of the rating will allow Moody's to assess any government support measures and make a more informed assessment of the potential credit impact.
TRT's A3 rating incorporates the Tianjin municipal government's capacity to support (GCS) score of a3 and Moody's assessment of how the company's characteristics affect the government's propensity to provide support, resulting in no notching adjustments.
Tianjin city's GCS score reflects (1) its status as one of four municipalities that report directly to the Government of China (A1 stable), (2) its relatively weak economic and fiscal metrics in recent years, (3) high risks from its contingent liabilities, and (4) increased liquidity pressure associated with its LGFVs compared with its peers.
TRT's A3 rating considers (1) the Tianjin municipal government's propensity to support the company, based on TRT's primary role in owning, constructing and operating the city's metro systems; (2) the company's participation in national rail projects on behalf of the Tianjin government; (3) its ultimate ownership and management by the Tianjin government; and (4) the exceptionally strong support and predictable payments from the Tianjin government to cover its operating losses, debt and part of its capital expansion requirements.
TRT's credit profile is constrained by its vulnerability to bond market volatility given investors' widespread risk aversion toward state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and LGFVs from regions with relatively weak credit metrics and high contingent liabilities.
The extended review period will focus on whether any forthcoming support measures will likely materially reduce the Tianjin government's contingent liability risks, which include a high reliance on short-term funding and high LGFV debt burden. Moody's will also assess if there are any measures and plans to reduce the Tianjin government's total debt burden, in terms of direct debt and contingent liabilities relative to fiscal revenue, to a level comparable with its peers with an a3 GCS score, amid a weak property market in China.
Moody's could confirm the TRT's ratings if the Tianjin municipal government's GCS score remains unchanged at a3, reflected in a material and sustainable improvement in its SOEs' and LGFVs' access to longer-term funding, including through sufficient government support and strengthened market reaction. These in turn would address questions related to debt sustainability and uncertainties over the government's ability to coordinate timely support for its SOEs and LGFVs under liquidity pressure.
However, Moody's could downgrade the TRT's ratings if the Tianjin government's capacity to support does not improve, reflected in its major SOEs' and LGFVs' continued reliance on short-term funding and its weak revenue generation. Ongoing risks to its debt sustainability, including through contingent liabilities, would indicate the government's weaker ability to coordinate timely support.
A downgrade of TRT's ratings could also occur if China's sovereign rating is downgraded.
Moody's could downgrade TRT's rating if the company's characteristics change in a way that lowers the Tianjin municipal government's propensity to support, such as:
- significant adverse changes in its ongoing government support mechanism that weaken the adequacy and timeliness of government payments on a sustained basis;
- a significant weakening in TRT's policy functions;
- TRT engaging in high-risk, competitive or leveraged business outside its role as a provider of rail and infrastructure services in Tianjin; or
- a significant weakening in its access to funding because of market volatility.
