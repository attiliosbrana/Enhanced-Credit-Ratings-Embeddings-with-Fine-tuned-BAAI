Approximately $252 million of structured securities affected
New York, August 23, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service, ("Moody's") has downgraded the ratings on five classes in Morgan Stanley Capital I Trust 2019-NUGS, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2019-NUGS as follows:
Cl. A, Downgraded to A1 (sf); previously on Mar 1, 2023 Downgraded to Aa1 (sf)
Cl. B, Downgraded to Baa2 (sf); previously on Mar 1, 2023 Downgraded to A2 (sf)
Cl. C, Downgraded to Ba1 (sf); previously on Mar 1, 2023 Downgraded to Baa2 (sf)
Cl. D, Downgraded to B1 (sf); previously on Mar 1, 2023 Downgraded to Ba2 (sf)
Cl. E, Downgraded to Caa1 (sf); previously on Mar 1, 2023 Downgraded to B2 (sf)
RATINGS RATIONALE
The ratings on five P&I classes were downgraded due to an increase in Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) ratio because of the decline in the property's performance since securitization and the anticipated further declines in its net operating income (NOI). This floating rate loan transferred to special servicing in December 2022 after failing to extend or pay off at its first extended maturity date. The property's occupancy decreased from 87% at securitization to 79% as of March 2023, and the property's 2022 reported NOI was 14% lower than its trailing-twelve-month NOI reported as of September 2019. The property's NOI is anticipated to see a further decline from the lower occupancy after two major tenants recently reduced their space. Furthermore, the risk of interest shortfalls may increase due to the recent appraisal reduction amount (ARA). An updated appraised value reported as of the June 2023 remittance report showed a decline in the appraised value of 40% from securitization which has caused ARA of $14.1 million. While the loan remains current on its interest only debt service payments as of the August 2023 remittance statement, there are also outstanding tax and insurance advances totaling approximately $8.2 million.
In this credit rating action we considered qualitative and quantitative factors in relation to the senior-sequential structure and trophy/dominant nature of the asset, and we analyzed multiple scenarios to reflect various levels of stress in property values could impact loan proceeds at each rating level.
FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:
The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected. Additionally, significant changes in the 5-year rolling average of 10-year US Treasury rates will impact the magnitude of the interest rate adjustment and may lead to future rating actions.
Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant amount of loan paydowns or amortization or a significant improvement in the loan's performance.
Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a further decline in actual or expected performance of the loan or interest shortfalls.

DEAL PERFORMANCE
As of the August 2023 distribution date, the transaction's aggregate certificate balance remains unchanged at $277.1 million from securitization. The 5-year (including three one-year extensions with a final maturity date in December 2024), interest only, floating rate loan is secured by a 1,195,149 square feet (SF), Class A, office property comprised of 52-story tower and an adjoining 12-story garage located in the central business district (CBD) of Denver, Colorado. In addition, the property is encumbered by $50.6 million of non-pooled B-note and $45.3 million of non-pooled mezzanine debt.
The loan transferred to special servicing in December 2022 due to maturity default. The borrower previously exercised the loan's first extension option which extended the maturity date by one year, from December 2021 to December 2022. While the borrower had the second one-year extension option, the borrower didn't exercise the option largely due to increased interest rates and costs associated with an interest rate protection agreement for the extended term. The loan required an extension term strike rate that would result in a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.05x based on the total debt.
As of March 2023, the property was 79% leased, compared to 83% leased in June 2022, 86% in December 2020 and 87% at securitization.  The property's 2022 reported NOI was $20.5 million which was 8% lower than the NOI in 2021, 11% below that of 2020, and 14% lower than the trailing-twelve-month NOI reported as of September 2019. Based on the reported NOI in 2022, the senior mortgage loan balance of $277.1 million had a DSCR slightly above 1.00X at current SOFR rates, however, the total debt DSCR would be below 1.00X. Additionally, the property's NOI is anticipated to see further declines as two major tenants reduced their space recently. The fourth largest tenant at securitization, WeWork, negotiated an early termination agreement to vacate the 14th and 15th floors, effective May 1, 2023 and the 18th floor, effective July, 1, 2023, which represented a combined 69,683 SF (6% of the property net rentable area (NRA)). Furthermore, another major tenant, Bryan Cave HRO, downsized their spaces by 59,070 SF (5% of the property NRA) when renewing their lease that expired in December 2022. Accounting for the reduced space WeWork and Bryan Cave HRO now each represent approximately 4% of the NRA on leases through 2034 and 2035 respectively. With respect to the largest tenant, Wells Fargo Bank, a portion of their leases, (69,778 SF or 6% of the property NRA), expire in December 2023 and the remaining 175,115 SF (15% of the property NRA)  expire in December 2028.
The property is well-located in the Denver CBD, however, the Denver office market vacancies have increased since securitization. According to CBRE, the Downtown submarket in Denver, Colorado included 27.6 million SF of Class A office space in Q2 2023 with a vacancy of 24.4%, compared to a vacancy rate of 10.7% in 2019.
Moody's NCF was $17.3 million and the Moody's capitalization rate was increased from last review. Moody's LTV ratio for the first mortgage balance is 145% based on our Moody's Value and the Adjusted Moody's LTV ratio for the first mortgage balance is 128% based on our Moody's Value using a cap rate adjusted for the current interest rate environment. Moody's stressed DSCR is 0.67x for the first mortgage balance.  The loan is classified as "performing maturity balloon" and is current on its interest-only debt service payments through the August 2023 remittance date and there are outstanding interest shortfalls totaling $3,105 affecting up to Cl. F. No losses have been realized as of the current distribution date and there are outstanding tax and insurance advances totaling approximately $8.2 million.
