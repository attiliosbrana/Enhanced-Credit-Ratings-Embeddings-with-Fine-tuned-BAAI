Moody's downgrades Drexel University's (PA) issuer and debt ratings to Baa1; outlook stable
New York, August 24, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service has downgraded Drexel University's (PA) issuer and revenue bond ratings to Baa1 from A3. The outlook is stable. The university has about $1.1 billion of debt outstanding on a pro forma basis.  
RATINGS RATIONALE
The downgrade of Drexel University's issuer rating to Baa1 was largely driven by the material weakening in debt affordability owing to thin operating performance and the recent execution of a large, long-term operating lease that will carry a $477 million liability. Inclusive of the new lease, pro forma debt to EBIDA rose to over 18x in fiscal 2022, nearly three times higher than peer medians. While the university's large scope of operations provides for significant economies of scale, the ongoing challenges of aligning revenue and expense growth will make it difficult to achieve significant and sustained improvement in operating performance and debt affordability. Additional credit risk is introduced by the university's ownership stake in a children's hospital with a history of deep operating losses prior to fiscal 2023 and a clinical partner confronting heightened financial challenges.
Drexel's credit quality positively incorporates its very good brand and strategic positioning as an urban private university with significant wealth and scale, and a business model providing for market distinction. Total cash and investments topped $1.0 billion in fiscal 2022, while operating revenue amounted to $954 million. The university's diverse program mix, well-regarded cooperative education program, and investments in new academic initiatives and facilities will continue to support steady student demand despite heightened competition and weak regional demographics. Management's articulated plans to enhance revenue and control expense growth strengthens prospects for sustaining break-even operating results.  
The Baa1 revenue bond ratings reflect the university's issuer rating and the general obligation characteristics of the bonds.
RATING OUTLOOK
The stable outlook reflects Moody's expectations of generally steady operating performance, stable student demand, and no further material increase in financial leverage beyond the new lease. The outlook also incorporates expectations that St. Christopher's will remain cash flow positive.  
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OF THE RATINGS
- Sustained strengthening in operating performance and debt to EBIDA
- Significant growth in financial reserves and operating revenue, leading to materially stronger coverage of total adjusted debt
- Improvement in brand and strategic positioning, reflected in sustained positive trends in student demand, fundraising, and revenue growth
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO A DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
- Sustained weakening in operating performance
- Material downturn in monthly days cash on hand
- Significant increase in financial leverage beyond fiscal 2023
- Erosion in the financial performance of St. Christopher's Hospital for Children
LEGAL SECURITY
All bonds are a general obligation of the university with a secured interest in unrestricted gross revenue. There is also a collateral agreement to which the state treasurer agrees to withhold certain appropriations from Pennsylvania payable to the university in the event of a default.
