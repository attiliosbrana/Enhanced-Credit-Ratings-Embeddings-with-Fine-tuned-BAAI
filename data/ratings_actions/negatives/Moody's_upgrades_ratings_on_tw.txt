Moody's upgrades ratings on two classes of notes and downgrades rating on one class of CLO notes issued by OZLM IX, Ltd.
$84 million of notes affected
New York, August 21, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") has upgraded the ratings on the following notes issued by OZLM IX, Ltd.:
U.S.$49,500,000 Class A-2-R3 Senior Secured Floating Rate Notes due 2031 (the "Class A-2-R3 Notes"), Upgraded to Aaa (sf); previously on October 20, 2021 Assigned Aa2 (sf)
U.S.$25,000,000 Class B-RR Senior Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2031 (the "Class B-RR Notes"), Upgraded to Aa3 (sf); previously on November 8, 2018 Assigned A2 (sf)
Moody's has also downgraded the rating on the following notes:
U.S.$9,500,000 Class E-RR Secured Deferrable Floating Rate Notes due 2031 (the "Class E-RR Notes"), Downgraded to Caa2 (sf); previously on August 19, 2020 Downgraded to Caa1 (sf)
OZLM IX, Ltd., originally issued in December 2014 and last refinanced in October 2021, is a managed cashflow CLO. The notes are collateralized primarily by a portfolio of broadly syndicated senior secured corporate loans. The transaction's reinvestment period will end in October 2023.
RATINGS RATIONALE
The upgrading rating actions reflect the benefit of the short period of time remaining before the end of the deal's reinvestment period in October 2023. In light of the reinvestment restrictions during the amortization period which limit the ability of the manager to effect significant changes to the current collateral pool, Moody's analyzed the deal assuming a higher likelihood that the collateral pool characteristics will be maintained and continue to satisfy certain covenant requirements. In particular, Moody's assumed that the deal will benefit from lower weighted average rating factor (WARF), higher weighted average spread (WAS) and diversity levels compared to their respective covenant levels.  Moody's modeled a WARF of 2599 compared to the covenant level of 2776, WAS of 3.30% compared to the covenant level of 3.10%, and diversity score of 82 compared to the covenant level of 80. The deal has also benefited from a shortening of the portfolio's weighted average life since July 2022.
The downgrade rating action on the Class E-RR notes reflects the specific risks to the junior notes posed by par loss observed in the underlying CLO portfolio. Based on the trustee's July 2023 report [1], the overcollateralization ratio for the Class E-RR notes (the Reinvestment Overcollateralization Test) is reported at 103.13% compared to July 2022 trustee reported level of 104.41% [2].
Moody's modeled the transaction using a cash flow model based on the Binomial Expansion Technique, as described in "Moody's Global Approach to Rating Collateralized Loan Obligations."
The key model inputs Moody's used in its analysis, such as par, weighted average rating factor, diversity score, weighted average spread, and weighted average recovery rate, are based on its published methodology and could differ from the trustee's reported numbers. For modeling purposes, Moody's used the following base-case assumptions:
Performing par and principal proceeds balance: $477,668,939
Defaulted par:  $3,878,978
Diversity Score: 82
Weighted Average Rating Factor (WARF): 2599
Weighted Average Spread (WAS) (before accounting for reference rate floors): 3.30%
Weighted Average Recovery Rate (WARR): 46.71%
Weighted Average Life (WAL): 4.30 years
In addition to base case analysis, Moody's ran additional scenarios where outcomes could diverge from the base case. The additional scenarios consider one or more factors individually or in combination, and include: defaults by obligors whose low ratings or debt prices suggest distress, defaults by obligors with potential refinancing risk, deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying portfolio, decrease in overall WAS or net interest income, lower recoveries on defaulted assets.
Methodology Used for the Rating Action:
The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Moody's Global Approach to Rating Collateralized Loan Obligations" published in December 2021 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/rmc-documents/74832. Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.
Factors that Would Lead to an Upgrade or Downgrade of the Ratings:
The performance of the rated notes is subject to uncertainty. The performance of the rated notes is sensitive to the performance of the underlying portfolio, which in turn depends on economic and credit conditions that may change.  The Manager's investment decisions and management of the transaction will also affect the performance of the rated notes.
