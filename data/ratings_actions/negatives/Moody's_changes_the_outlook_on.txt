Moody's changes the outlook on Moldova's rating to stable from negative; affirms B3 rating
London, August 18, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has today affirmed the foreign and domestic-currency long-term issuer ratings of the Government of Moldova at B3, and changed the outlook to stable from negative.
The decision to change the outlook to stable reflects Moody's assessment that risks to Moldova's credit profile are balanced at the B3 rating level.
The impact on Moldova's credit profile from Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine (Ca stable) has been less severe than expected at the time of Moody's last rating action in April 2022, even as the war has significantly weighed on the country's economic and fiscal performance. Moldova has made significant progress in improving its energy security, with access to new sources of supply heading into next winter, even as significant vulnerabilities remain. Moody's expects substantial financial and technical support from international institutions will continue to bolster Moldova's credit profile by fostering the economic recovery, mitigating liquidity risks and supporting gradual progress on structural reforms. That said, event risks from the prolonged war and volatile domestic politics remain high.
The affirmation of the B3 ratings balances Moldova's limited economic resilience to withstand shocks with the country's moderate government debt burden. Moldova's weak institutional framework is gradually improving as part of the European Union (EU, Aaa stable) accession process, reflecting Moldova's willingness and ability under the current government to absorb technical expertise and financial support from international partners. The affirmation also reflects Moody's expectation that significant international financing support will continue to help mitigate government liquidity and external vulnerability risks.
Moldova's local and foreign-currency ceilings remain unchanged at Ba3 and B2, respectively. The three-notch gap between the local-currency ceiling and the sovereign rating reflects the elevated political risks, somewhat elevated external vulnerabilities and moderate predictability of government and institutions. The two-notch gap between the foreign-currency ceiling and the local-currency ceiling reflects very limited capital account openness, weak policy effectiveness, and somewhat elevated external indebtedness which push the foreign-currency ceiling below the local-currency ceiling.
RATINGS RATIONALE
RATIONALE FOR THE CHANGE IN OUTLOOK TO STABLE FROM NEGATIVE
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO ENERGY SECURITY EVEN AS VULNERABILITIES REMAIN
Moldova's energy resilience has proven stronger than Moody's expected, benefitting from significant technical and financing support from international institutions, which supports the stable outlook on the B3 ratings.
Notably, Moldova has established new arrangements to source gas after Russia cut its supply in late 2022, including from the EU via the Ungheni pipeline connection with Romania (Baa3 stable), while a switch to using heavy fuel oil for heating has contributed to a reduction in natural gas consumption. The authorities have also been building up external gas storage reserves, benefitting from the loan facility provided by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD, Aaa stable), which will likely, in Moody's view, provide a couple of months buffer for next winter.
Furthermore, the synchronization with the Continental European Grid has allowed Moldova to import electricity from the EU in case of need, although capacity is still constrained. In particular, Moldova was able to import the vast majority of its electricity from Romania in November 2022 when domestic supply was disrupted, albeit at a higher cost. Ongoing efforts to improve the electricity infrastructure, including the planned development of a new high voltage power line with Romania by 2025, would significantly further improve Moldova's energy resilience. More broadly, the government's focus on energy security, including the creation of a separate Ministry focused on energy, will likely support further improvements.
That said, in Moody's assessment, significant vulnerabilities in Moldova's energy sector remain, although the country is markedly better prepared than last winter, in terms of financing support, technical assistance and know-how to manage future energy shocks. Moldova currently sources the vast majority of its electricity from the gas-fired power plant in the Russian-backed separatist Transnistria region and its continued supply remains vulnerable to geopolitical developments. Furthermore, Moldova can experience power disruptions in the event of damage to Ukrainian energy infrastructure, as experienced in late 2022. Efforts to unbundle the gas market, which would align the sector with EU practices and reduce Gazprom's influence in the market, will, in Moody's view, continue to face significant hurdles.
SUBSTANTIAL ENGAGEMENT FROM INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS WILL SUPPORT ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND MITIGATE LIQUIDITY RISKS
The stable outlook also reflects Moody's expectation that continued substantial support from international institutions will underpin the economic recovery, mitigate liquidity risks, and foster gradual reform momentum in the face of significant economic and fiscal pressures arising from the war in Ukraine.
Moldova continues to receive extensive financing support given substantial engagement from international partners and a strong commitment by the government to meeting programme conditionality. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has disbursed around $371 million as part of its latest economic reform programme (totaling around $800 million) which was augmented following the onset of the war[1]. The European Council recently increased its Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) programme, bringing the total amount of MFA support to close to €300 million[2], which sits alongside the EU's budget support package for Moldova.
Moldova has adapted well to the disruption to its trading routes, supported by the temporary suspension of import duties and quotas on Moldovan exports to the EU, with exports to the bloc rising by more than 30% in 2022. The EU has also committed to mobilise up to €1.6 billion as part of its Economic and Investment Plan, which will help to support investment in the face of fragile sentiment from the prolonged war in Ukraine. Furthermore, remittance inflows, with money transfers from abroad growing by around 8% in 2022, will continue to support consumption. Moody's expects economic activity to remain volatile and weak in 2023 before real GDP growth returns close to potential of around 4% in 2024.
At the same time, liquidity risks will continue to be mitigated by significant financing support even as the fiscal outlook faces risks from the war and a further energy price shock. Moody's expects the general government budget deficit to reach around 6% of GDP in 2023 and remain elevated as the government seeks to reorient fiscal policy towards meeting development objectives. As a result, the government debt burden will rise to around 37% of GDP in 2024, although remaining lower than the median of B-rated sovereigns. Foreign exchange reserves have also benefitted from the large inflows of international financing support, which will provide an important buffer against external vulnerability risks.
Moody's expects gradual progress on structural reforms to continue, underpinned by Moldova receiving EU candidacy status in June 2022, even as actual membership remains a distant prospect. Despite the very challenging geopolitical environment, the government is making progress on the nine reform criteria which need to be met in order to open formal EU accession negotiations. That said, implementation risks remain high, particularly given vested interests.
DOMESTIC AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS REMAIN HIGH
The stable outlook also captures elevated political event risks which constrain Moldova's credit profile. Domestic political volatility in Moldova will remain high, having been exacerbated by an acceleration in domestic interference by Russia. That said, public support for Moldova's aspiration to become an EU member remains strong, with pro-EU sentiment likely bolstered by the country hosting the European Political Community summit in June 2023, even as a large share of the population continues to also view Russia as an important political and economic partner.
Local elections in November 2023 will prove a key test of public support for the government's policies ahead of the next parliamentary elections due in 2025. Recent polling suggests that Moldova's strongly pro-EU ruling PAS party continues to enjoy the largest share of public support, although the rapid pace of reform has generated some discontent. A reversal away from the EU accession process following the next parliamentary election would hinder reform progress and jeopardise Moldova's access to liquidity support.
At the same time, geopolitical risks from the prolonged war in Ukraine remain high, though the likelihood of Russia's military invasion spilling over into Moldova has receded as fighting remains concentrated mainly in the eastern part of Ukraine. Furthermore, the presence of Russian troops in the separatist Transnistria region poses a risk to Moldova's stability, although it would be operationally very challenging for Russia to use the region as a new outpost for the war.
RATIONALE FOR AFFIRMING THE B3 RATINGS
The affirmation of Moldova's B3 ratings reflects the sovereign's limited economic resilience given its narrow economic base, which weighs on Moldova's capacity to absorb shocks. Unfavourable demographics weigh on the country's growth potential as high levels of emigration, given limited job opportunities and relatively high poverty levels, contribute to a rapid decline in the working age population.
Moldova's limited capacity to absorb shocks is also reflected in its weak institutions, although the institutional framework is gradually improving as part of the EU accession process. The affirmation also reflects the government's moderate government debt burden relative to rating peers which comprises largely of concessional financing in foreign currency, although high levels of state ownership increase contingent liability risks for the sovereign balance sheet.
Moody's expects inflation will fall sharply to high single digits this year after peaking at more than 34% in 2022, with the central bank remaining among the most credible of Moldova's institutions. The banking sector is expected to continue to demonstrate a high degree of resilience to shocks, benefitting from previous reforms which helped address financial vulnerabilities and improved regulatory oversight and governance in the sector.
Finally, Moody's expectation that significant international financing support will continue to help mitigate government liquidity and external vulnerability risks, particularly in the absence of any international bond issuances, underpins the affirmation of the B3 rating.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
Moldova's ESG Credit Impact Score is CIS-4, reflecting high exposure to social risks and a weak governance profile, the latter also explaining the relatively low resilience to shocks despite a favorable debt burden.
Moldova's E-3 issuer profile score is driven by physical climate risk, exacerbated by the importance of the agricultural sector (both in terms of economic contribution and employment). Historical evidence suggests that droughts can create severe economic, fiscal and social costs. Moldova also faces environmental risks from water scarcity and weak management of natural capital.
Exposure to social risks (S-4 issuer profile score) is mainly related to unfavourable demographics, weak health outcomes and impaired access to basic services, while education is not a material source of risk. A significant part of the country's population has emigrated, mainly because of a lack of job opportunities and relatively high poverty levels. The shrinking population is a major constraint on the economy as it weighs on the country's labour input.
Moldova's governance profile score (G-4 issuer profile) reflects weak rule of law and high levels of corruption, although the institutional framework has been gradually improving. These aspects result in a relatively low resilience due to low institutional capacity to respond to environmental and social risks, in part mitigated by favorable fiscal metrics.
GDP per capita (PPP basis, US$): 15,617 (2022) (also known as Per Capita Income)
Real GDP growth (% change): -5.9% (2022) (also known as GDP Growth)

Default history: At least one default event (on bonds and/or loans) has been recorded since 1983.
On 15 August 2023, a rating committee was called to discuss the rating of the Moldova, Government of. The main points raised during the discussion were: The issuer's economic fundamentals, including its economic strength, have materially improved. The issuer's institutions and governance strength, have materially increased. The issuer's fiscal or financial strength, including its debt profile, has materially increased. The issuer's susceptibility to event risks has not materially changed.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
Moldova's ratings could be upgraded if there was evidence of strong progress on implementing structural reforms, resulting in a significant strengthening of the country's institutions and governance profile. Improvements to the country's long-standing structural economic impediments, including the weak business climate and narrow economic base, would also support the emergence of upward rating pressure. Continued strong engagement with international partners, including progress on the EU accession process, would be a key factor supporting an improvement in the ratings.
Moldova's ratings could be downgraded if geopolitical risks stemming from Russia's prolonged invasion of Ukraine were to crystallise. While a lower probability than at the onset of the war, a further energy shock which cannot be mitigated by technical and financial support from international partners or an extension of the military conflict to Moldova would have a very significant negative impact on the credit profile. Evidence of increased domestic political volatility, including a weakening in the government's commitment towards EU accession, which jeopardises the large commitments of international financial support and leads to a reversal in reforms, would be negative for the ratings.
