Fitch Downgrades DFC-Guaranteed Latam SF Transactions to 'AA+' Post Sovereign Action; Outlook Stable

Fitch Ratings - SÃ£o Paulo - 07 Aug 2023: Fitch Ratings has downgraded six credit linked notes (CLN) ratings to 'AA+sf' from 'AAAsf' from six Latin American structured finance transactions following the agency's recent downgrade of the United States' Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'AA+' from 'AAA'. The Rating Watch Negative has been removed and a Stable Rating Outlook has been assigned.
The CLN ratings are linked to the credit quality of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), which in turn is directly linked to the U.S. sovereign, and have been on Rating Watch Negative since May 26, 2023.

Additionally, Fitch has affirmed the Unenhanced Long-Term Rating (ULT) of La Hipotecaria Panamanian Mortgage Trust 2010-1 certificates at 'A-sf'/Outlook Stable, which are linked to series A notes of La Hipotecaria's Tenth Mortgage-Backed Notes Trust.
