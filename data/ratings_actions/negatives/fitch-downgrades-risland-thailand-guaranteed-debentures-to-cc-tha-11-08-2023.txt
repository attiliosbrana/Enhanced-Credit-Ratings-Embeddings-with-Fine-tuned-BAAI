Fitch Downgrades Risland (Thailand)'s Guaranteed Debentures to 'CC(tha)'

Fitch Ratings - Bangkok - 11 Aug 2023: Fitch Ratings (Thailand) has downgraded the National Long-Term Rating on the guaranteed debentures of Risland (Thailand) Company Limited (RLT) to 'CC(tha)', from 'B-(tha)'.
The debentures are guaranteed by RLT's 100% parent, China-based Country Garden Holdings Company Limited (CGH).
KEY RATING DRIVERS
The downgrade reflects Fitch's view of a further deterioration in CGH's credit profile, which raises the risk of an event of default being triggered on RLT's guaranteed debentures.
CGH provides a full, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the debentures. The guarantee ranks at least pari passu with CGH's unsecured and unsubordinated obligations.
DERIVATION SUMMARY
The rating on the guaranteed debentures is based on the credit profile of the guarantor, CGH.
RATING SENSITIVITIES
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:
- Evidence that RLT can meet its debt obligations, including the debentures due in October 2023, independently of CGH
- Strengthening of CGH's credit profile
Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:
- If RLT defaults on its debt obligations or enters into a default-like process
ISSUER PROFILE
RLT is a Thailand-based homebuilder, and it is indirectly owned by CGH, a leading home builder in Guangdong, China. RLT launched its first two projects in Thailand in 2018. It now has seven condominium and low-rise projects.
