Moody's changes INEOS Quattro's outlook to negative; corporate family rating affirmed at Ba3
London, August 16, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has today affirmed INEOS Quattro Holdings Ltd's (INEOS Quattro) Ba3 corporate family rating (CFR), its Ba3-PD probability of default rating, along with Ba3 ratings of its backed senior secured bank credit facilities issued by INEOS Quattro Holdings UK Ltd and INEOS US Petrochem LLC, backed Ba3 senior secured notes issued by INEOS Quattro Finance 2 Plc, Ba3 senior secured notes and the Ba3 senior secured bank credit facility issued by INEOS Styrolution Group GmbH, and the Ba3 senior secured bank credit facility issued by Ineos Styrolution US Holding LLC. The B2 rating of the backed senior unsecured notes issued by INEOS Quattro Finance 1 Plc is also affirmed. The rating outlook has been revised to negative from stable for all entities.
RATINGS RATIONALE
Today's rating action reflects INEOS Quattro's weak performance in the first half of 2023 as well as the expectation of delayed recovery.  Previously, Moody's expected INEOS Quattro's revenues and EBITDA to return to mid-cycle levels in the second half of 2023; however, this is now not anticipated until 2024.  As a result, INEOS Quattro's credit profile will be pressured for a longer period of time than previously anticipated.  INEOS Quattro's leverage rose sharply to 5.3x for the twelve months ending June 2023 from 2.6x in 2022 as the chemical industry shifted from the cyclical peak in the second quarter of 2022 closer to the cyclical trough a year later. Moody's now expects INEOS Quattro's leverage to be at approximately at 6.3x for 2023 before reducing in 2024 to below 4.5x in line with the rating guidance.
The weakness in INEOS Quattro's performance is driven by reduced demand for durables down from above-peak levels during the pandemic, although somewhat offset by stronger demand from the automotive sector which is benefitting from improvements in access to semiconductors and filling the backlog of orders.  This backlog is expected to support demand at least through the end of 2023.  In addition, broad inflationary pressures are crimping demand across INEOS Quattro's end markets and Chinese economy is recovering slower than forecast earlier in the year.  Also, as expected, new styrene capacity was added in China pressuring the styrene margins.
Counterbalancing these challenges, INEOS continues to benefit from good liquidity including no maturities ahead of January 2026 and over €2 billion of cash at June 2023, along with two undrawn securitisation facilities totaling €840 million and maturing in June 2024.
The Ba3 corporate family rating of INEOS Quattro Holdings Ltd (formerly INEOS Styrolution) reflects the company's large size and scope, with leading market positions globally in a variety of chemical products; its diverse product lines and end-markets; as well as successful integration following the merger with INOVYN and acquisition of BP aromatics and acetyls assets exceeding initial synergy expectations.
These positives are counterbalanced by the cyclical nature of the commodity chemical industry which is currently experiencing a period of material market weakness owing to reducing demand across many end markets; a history of significant risk appetite across the broader INEOS Group; and the limited available disclosure regarding the larger INEOS Group outside of the rated entities.
LIQUIDITY
INEOS' liquidity is good with over €2 billion of cash at 30 June 2023 and undrawn working capital facilities of €840 million. The company's nearest debt maturity is in January 2026. INEOS has recently been successful in refinancing its upcoming maturities in the capital markets.
STRUCTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
The senior secured debt of INEOS Quattro (issued through subsidiaries) is rated Ba3, at the same level as its CFR of Ba3, and the senior unsecured debt (also issued through subsidiaries) is rated B2. Given the relative size of the two classes of debt, the support provided by the unsecured debt is not sufficient to justify any notching between the secured debt and the CFR.
The senior secured instruments rank pari passu and benefit from guarantees from subsidiaries that constitute at least 85% of group EBITDA. The collateral includes substantially all assets of the company, including cash, bank accounts, inventories and property, plant & equipment (PP&E), but excludes receivables that are pledged to asset securitisation programmes.
RATING OUTLOOK
Negative rating outlook reflects Moody's expectation that INEOS Quattro's earnings will continue to be pressured by reduced demand globally through the second half of 2023 and into 2024, thereby delaying the company's return to a credit profile commensurate with the current rating.  The agency also expects no additional dividend payments in the near term; any further dividends paid before market conditions have improved resulting in a recovery of the company's EBITDA generation would further pressure the rating.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
Although unlikely in the near term, positive rating pressure would occur if Moody's-adjusted leverage measured as debt/EBITDA is reduced to well below 4.0x on a sustained basis while generating positive free cash flow (FCF) and maintaining good liquidity at all times.
Conversely, negative rating pressure could occur if leverage is sustained above 4.5x for over 12 months. Any significant deterioration in liquidity or further dividend payments could also cause negative rating pressure.
