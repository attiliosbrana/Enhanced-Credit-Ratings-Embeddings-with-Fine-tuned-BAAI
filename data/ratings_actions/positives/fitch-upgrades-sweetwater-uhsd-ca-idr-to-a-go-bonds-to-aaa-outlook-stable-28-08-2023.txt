In addition, Fitch has upgraded the district's Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A' from 'A-'.
The Rating Outlook on the IDR and GO bonds is Stable.
The distinction between the 'AAA' GO bond ratings and the 'A' IDR reflects Fitch's assessment that the property tax revenues supporting the GO bonds are 'pledged special revenues' based on Fitch's review of legal opinions provided by the district.
