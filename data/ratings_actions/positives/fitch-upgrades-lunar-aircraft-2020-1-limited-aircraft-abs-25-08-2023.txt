These ratings reflect current transaction performance, Fitch's cash flow projections, and its expectation for the structure to withstand stress scenarios commensurate with their respective ratings within the framework of Fitch's new criteria and related asset model. The rating actions also consider lease terms, lessee credit quality and performance, updated aircraft values, and Fitch's assumptions and stresses, which inform our modeled cash flows and coverage levels. Fitch's updated rating assumptions for airlines are based on a variety of performance metrics and airline characteristics.
