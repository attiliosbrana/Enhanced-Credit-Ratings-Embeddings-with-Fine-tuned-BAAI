Moody's changes the outlook on Constellium to positive; affirms its B1 CFR
Frankfurt am Main, August 21, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") has today changed the outlook to positive from stable on Constellium SE (Constellium). Concurrently, Moody's has affirmed Constellium's B1 corporate family rating (CFR), its B1-PD probability of default rating (PDR), as well as the B1 rating of its backed senior unsecured notes.
"The change of the outlook to positive from stable primarily reflects Constellium continuing to perform ahead of our expectations in a difficult operating environment with persistent inflation, while maintaining financial discipline.", says Martin Fujerik, a Moody's Vice President – Senior Credit Officer and lead analyst on Constellium. "The likelihood has increased that the company will further improve its credit metrics to levels consistent with a higher rating over the next 12-18 months.", adds Mr. Fujerik.
RATINGS RATIONALE
Constellium has continued to deliver stronger operational results with higher earnings during 2023 than Moody's expected. The company has coped well with lower shipments in some of its key markets and persistent inflation of some input costs, including labour and energy. Strong momentum in the aerospace market - Constellium's most profitable end market – has been the main driver of this better-than-expected performance.
Furthermore, the company has maintained discipline in capital allocation and even reduced gross debt during the year. Constellium remains committed to a continued reduction of its reported net leverage to 2.5x, keeping it between 1.5x and 2.5x afterwards. The ratio declined to 2.7x for 12 months to June 2023, a multi-year low, from 2.8x in 2022, while Moody's expected a modest increase.
The positive outlook reflects an increasing likelihood that over the next 12-18 months the company will be able to further expand its EBITDA, thus reaching credit metrics that would be commensurate with a higher rating, such as Moody's adjusted gross debt/EBITDA below 4.0x (4.1x for 12 months to June 2023, excluding metals price lag) and Moody's-adjusted (cash flow from operations [CFO]-dividends)/debt at around 20% (17.3%).
However, there are uncertainties to this forecast. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging, with a risk of a continued sluggish growth in several of Constellium's end markets, including packaging. Although the rating agency expects volumes in the aerospace market to continue growing, as the market keeps recovering from its pandemic-induced downturn, the exceptionally high EBITDA per ton that Constellium generated in its Aerospace and Transportation segment during H1 2023 might not be sustained. Furthermore, there are still some uncertainties about Constellium's capital allocation priorities once it reaches its 1.5x-2.5x net leverage target range; particularly with regards to shareholder remuneration that it is now likely to start considering.
The company also modestly improved its liquidity during H1 2023, which Moody's views as adequate. The rating agency's expectation that Constellium will maintain solid free cash flow (FCF) generation over the next 12-18 months, despite a relatively high level of growth investments, supports this assessment. At the end of June 2023, the company reported around €180 million cash and cash equivalents, with around €570 million available under its committed lending facilities and factoring arrangements, facing relatively limited and manageable debt maturities until 2026.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
Further upward pressure on the ratings would build, if Constellium's (1) Moody's-adjusted debt/EBITDA reduced sustainably below 4.0x; (2) Moody's-adjusted (CFO - dividends)/debt improved to at least 20%; and (3) Moody's-adjusted FCF remained consistently positive.
Negative rating pressure could develop, if Constellium's (1) Moody's-adjusted debt/EBITDA  consistently exceeded 5.0x; (2) Moody's-adjusted (CFO - dividends)/debt fell sustainably below 15%; (3) Moody's-adjusted FCF turned sustainably negative; or (4) liquidity deteriorated.
