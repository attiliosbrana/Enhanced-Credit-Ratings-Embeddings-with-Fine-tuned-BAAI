Moody's says Permian Resources' acquisition of Earthstone does not immediately affect ratings or positive outlook
New York, August 21, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) commented that Permian Resources Corporation's (Permian Resources) acquisition of Earthstone Energy, Inc. (Earthstone) does not immediately affect Permian Resources Operating, LLC's ratings, including its B1 Corporate Family Rating (CFR) or positive outlook. Permian Resources Operating, LLC is a subsidiary  of Permian Resources Corporation. Today, Permian Resources announced that it will acquire Earthstone in an all-stock transaction valued at about $4.5 billion, including Earthstone's net debt. The transaction will enhance Permian Resources' position in the Permian Basin, creating synergy opportunities and increased economies of scale. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both Permian Resources and Earthstone. Permian Resources expects to close the transaction by the end of 2023, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Permian Resources and Earthstone have been active acquirors in the Permian Basin. Permian Resources was formed via the merger of Centennial Resources Production, LLC and Colgate Energy Partners III, LLC in September 2022, another transaction which also contributed to Permian Resources' growth. Earlier this month Earthstone closed on the acquisition of Novo Oil & Gas Holdings, Inc. (Novo), another company with assets in the Permian. Cash consideration included about $1.4 billion of cash (after taking into account preliminary purchase price adjustments at closing). Upon closing, Earthstone sold a one-third interest in Novo's oil and gas interests to Northern Oil & Gas, Inc. (NOG, B1 stable). Earthstone received about $468 million for this divestiture (this amount is net of preliminary purchase price adjustments).
The acquisition of Earthstone will add about 223,000 net acres in the Permian Basin, increasing Permian Resources' net acreage to over 400,000 net acres. Pro forma production for the combined companies is approximately 300 Mboe/d. The companies expect to realize annual synergies of about $175 million. Permian Resources' positive outlook already reflected the benefits of its rising scale in the Permian Basin and improving credit metrics. The pending acquisition of Earthstone further enhances its scale and could bolster its credit metrics, however, this is another very large acquisition that entails inherent valuation and execution risks. The combined company expects to have less than $1.0 billion drawn on the revolving credit facility at close. The company will need to demonstrate that it can generate competitive returns on investment from its consolidated drilling activities.
Following the acquisition, Permian Resources' variable dividend program will continue, with the company targeting the distribution of at least 50% of free cash flow, after the base dividend, via variable dividends and share repurchases. The company plans to increase its base dividend by 20% to $0.06 per share beginning in the first quarter of 2024. The company has a long-term leverage target of 0.5x – 1.0x.
Permian Resources has secured a $500 million incremental commitment under its revolving credit facility due February 2027, which will increase aggregate lender commitments from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. As of June 30, 2023, $300 million of borrowings were outstanding on the revolver. Permian Resources expects liquidity of the combined companies to be over $1 billion at closing of the transaction.
Each share of Earthstone will be exchanged for 1.446 shares of Permian Resources. Permian Resources will issue approximately 211 million shares of common stock as part of the transaction. Upon closing, Permian Resources shareholders will own about 73% of the combined company and Earthstone shareholders will own about 27%.
Permian Resources, headquartered in Midland, Texas, is a publicly traded exploration and production company operating in the Permian Basin.
