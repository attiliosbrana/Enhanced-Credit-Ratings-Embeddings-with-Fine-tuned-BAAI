RATINGS RATIONALE
The rating action is prompted by an increase in credit enhancement for the affected tranches, alongside excess spread having been sufficient to offset the defaults which have already occurred in the transaction.
Revision of Key Collateral Assumptions SME:
As part of the rating action, Moody's reassessed its default probability and recovery rate assumptions for the portfolio reflecting the collateral performance to date.
The performance of the transaction has continued to be stable since the previous rating action in February 2023. According to the August 2023 Investor Report[1], 30 plus day delinquencies are currently standing at 1.47% of the current pool balance, with 60 days plus arrears currently standing at 0.24% of current pool balance. Cumulative defaults currently stand at 6.99% of original pool balance, up from 5.53% in February 2023.
For SBOLT 2021-1, Moody's current default probability is 10.00% of the current portfolio balance and the assumption for the fixed recovery rate is 20.00%. Moody's has maintained its portfolio credit enhancement of 47.00%, which, combined with the key collateral assumptions, corresponds to a CoV of 60.18%.
Sequential amortization and trapping of excess spread led to the increase in the credit enhancement available in this transaction.
For instance, the credit enhancement for the Class C Notes increased to 54.0% from 38.3% since the last rating action.
