Moody's changes NGL Energy's outlook to positive, affirms B3 CFR
New York, August 23, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") changed NGL Energy Partners LP's (NGLEP) rating outlook to positive from negative. Moody's concurrently affirmed the company's B3 corporate family rating (CFR), B3-PD probability of default rating (PDR), and Caa2 senior unsecured notes. The speculative grade liquidity rating (SGL) was upgraded to SGL-3 from SGL-4. Moody's also affirmed NGL Energy Operating LLC's B2 senior secured first lien notes and changed its outlook to positive from negative.
"The positive outlook reflects NGLEP's commitment to continued debt reduction and our expectation of steady operational execution through 2024 that should reduce financial leverage and enable extension or repayment of future debt maturities," said Sajjad Alam, Moody's Vice President.

RATINGS RATIONALE
NGLEP's B3 CFR is restrained by its high debt load and the associated interest costs, large debt maturities through 2026, complex capital structure that includes significant secured debt and high-coupon cumulative preferred stocks, and the company's prior history of aggressive financial policies. The rating also reflects the inherent volatility and seasonality in NGLEP's working capital requirements and the high volumetric risks across all its business segments. NGL's businesses have performed more consistently in recent quarters leading to increasing free cash flow generation and meaningful debt reduction in 2023. Management has set debt reduction as the top strategic priority with a goal to dedicate substantially all near term free cash flow towards debt reduction. With additional deleveraging, NGLEP will be better positioned in 2024 to refinance its debt maturities and address the accumulating preferred dividends. NGLEP's primary strengths include its significant scale, diversified midstream operations across several key US hydrocarbon basins, fee-based business model, and large and growing water solutions business in the Delaware Basin.
The rating outlook is positive, reflecting Moody's expectation of steady operational execution and continued debt reduction that should reduce financial leverage and enable extension or repayment of future debt maturities.
The improved SGL-3 rating incorporates NGLEP's reduced near term refinancing risk and more credible free cash flow outlook. Moody's expects the company to generate at least $300 million in annual free cash flow over the next few years before distributions. As of June 30, 2023, the company had $8 million in cash and significant borrowing capacity under its $600 million ABL facility after excluding $180.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $142 million of letters of credit outstanding on the ABL. Moody's expects the company to reduce its ABL borrowings over time and comply with the financial covenants in the credit agreement through 2024. With a goal to further reduce leverage, management plans to redeem the remaining $281 million principal balance on the 2025 notes by March 31, 2024 using free cash flow and asset sales proceeds. NGLEP will have the right to redeem all or a portion of the outstanding 2026 notes ($320 million principal outstanding) at par plus accrued interest starting April 15, 2024. The ABL expires at the earliest of (a) February 4, 2026 or (b) 91 days prior to the earliest maturity date in respect to any of NGLEP's indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million or greater. Consequently, the company will need to reduce the 2025 notes balance below $50 million to avoid triggering a potential early ABL maturity in late-2024.
The secured notes are rated B2, one notch above the B3 CFR.  Moody's views the B2 rating as more appropriate than the lower rating suggested by Moody's Loss Given Default methodology based on the positive outlook for the CFR and the likelihood that the secured notes rating will likely converge with the CFR as the proportion of unsecured debt continues to decline with the projected repayments as reflected in the positive outlook. Therefore, if the company executes on its deleveraging plan and the CFR is upgraded to B2, the secured notes rating is likely to remain B2.  The unsecured notes are rated Caa2, two notches below the CFR given the high proportion of secured debt in NGLEP's capital structure and that notching differential to the CFR is likely to be sustained as the company reduces the proportion of unsecured debt in the capital structure.  
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
The ratings could be upgraded if NGLEP materially reduces debt and financial leverage, sufficiently addresses the repayment or refinancing risks involving its 2025 and 2026 notes and delivers consistent free cash flow in a stable to improving market. The ratings could be downgraded if the company is unable to resolve its maturity issues in a timely manner or its liquidity situation weakens materially. The rating could also be downgraded if the EBITDA/interest ratio cannot be sustained above 2.5x.
