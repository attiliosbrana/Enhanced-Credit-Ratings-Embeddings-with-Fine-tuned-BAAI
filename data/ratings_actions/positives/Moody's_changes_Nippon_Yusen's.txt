Moody's changes Nippon Yusen's outlook to positive; affirms Ba1 CFR
Tokyo, August 28, 2023 -- Moody's Japan K.K. has affirmed Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha's (NYK) Ba1 corporate family rating (CFR) and changed its outlook to positive from stable.
"The change in outlook reflects the company's progress in strengthening its business profile and its balance sheet," says Roman Schorr, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst.
"NYK will maintain stronger credit metrics than before the pandemic because of the better diversification of its asset base that it enhances its ability to control leverage," adds Schorr.
RATINGS RATIONALE
The positive outlook reflects Moody's expectation that NYK will sustain more stable profit and lower leverage than before the pandemic due to structural improvements in its business profile. NYK has reinvested the windfall cash from two exceptionally strong fiscal years in relatively stable segments such as LNG transportation and in more energy efficient vessels. It has also repaid debt ahead of its original plan.
NYK achieved record earnings in the year that ended in March 2023 (fiscal 2022), exceeding the previous year's record. It also reduced around JPY150 billion of debt, ahead of its publicly stated target of JPY100 billion.
The strong performance was driven by favorable market conditions, especially in its containership joint venture (JV), Ocean Network Express Pte. Ltd. (ONE). ONE turned extraordinarily profitable and began paying dividends in fiscal 2020. NYK received JPY105.6 billion of dividends from ONE in June 2023.
Moody's expects that market conditions will remain challenging over the next 12-18 months for the containership industry as the global fleet grows. This increased capacity, combined with the debottlenecking of supply chains, will keep containership rates below previous historic highs, reducing ONE's profits and therefore the dividends that NYK will receive from the JV.
That said, NYK's earnings visibility has improved from pre-pandemic levels across most of its segments, reflecting the company's increasing footprint in businesses with relatively stable earnings, such as LNG carriers and car carriers. The improved revenue diversification and the company's debt reduction provide a significant buffer against market volatility. Moody's expects growth in more stable segments to remain the focus of NYK's strategy, which will strengthen its business profile further.
NYK's Ba1 CFR reflects the shipping industry's volatile rates and the company's high investment needs, which could increase its leverage. These factors are offset by NYK's well-established market position among Japanese shipping companies, strong banking relationships that mitigate refinancing risk, large scale and diversified shipping portfolio, and unencumbered balance sheet.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING
Moody's could upgrade the rating if NYK reduces its debt further. A track record of more predictable cash flow, including dividends from ONE, as well as a commitment to lower its debt from current levels, will be credit positive. Moody's will consider an upgrade if the company maintains its debt/EBITDA below 3.5x and its retained cash flow/net debt above 20% through the business cycle.
Conversely, Moody's could downgrade the rating if the company's earnings and cash flow volatility rises. A more aggressive financial policy, including a material increase in shareholder returns or large debt-funded acquisitions or investments that do not result in a commensurate increase in stable cash flow will be credit negative. Negative rating pressure could also emerge if liquidity weakens. Moody's could downgrade the rating if leverage increases, such that debt/EBITDA exceeds 5.5x or its RCF/net debt falls toward the low teens.
