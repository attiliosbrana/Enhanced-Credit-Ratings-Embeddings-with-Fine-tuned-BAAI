RATINGS RATIONALE
The upgrade was prompted by an increase in note subordination available for the affected notes and the good performance of the underlying portfolio to date.
Following the August 2023 payment date, the note subordination available for the Class B-G, C-G, and D-G Notes has increased to 17.4%, 12.3%, and 9.6% respectively from 13.6%, 9.6%, and 7.5% at closing for these notes in November 2022.
As of end-July, 0.5% of the outstanding pool was 30-plus day delinquent and 0.1% was 90-plus day delinquent. The portfolio has incurred 0.1% (as a percentage of the original portfolio balance) of losses to date, all of which have been covered by excess spread.
Based on the observed performance to date and loan attributes, Moody's has lowered its expected default assumption to 3.25% as a percentage of the original pool balance (equivalent to 4% of the current balance) from 3.4% at closing. Moody's has also lowered its portfolio credit enhancement assumption to 22% from 23% at closing.
The transaction is a securitisation of a portfolio of Australian unsecured consumer and commercial Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL), and personal loan receivables originated by Brighte Capital Pty Ltd.
