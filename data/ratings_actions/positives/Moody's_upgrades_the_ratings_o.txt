* Reflects Interest-Only Classes
RATINGS RATIONALE
Today's rating actions reflect the recent performance as well as Moody's updated loss expectations on the underlying pools. The rating upgrades are a result of the improving performance of the related pools, and/or an increase in credit enhancement available to the bonds. In our analysis, we considered the likelihood of higher future pool expected losses due to rising borrower defaults driven by an increase in unemployment and inflation while prepayments remain broadly subdued amid elevated interest rates. The actions also reflect Moody's updated loss expectations on the pools which incorporate our assessment of the representations and warranties framework of the transactions, the due diligence findings of the third-party reviews at the time of issuance, and the transactions' servicing arrangement.
Principal Methodologies
The methodologies used in rating all classes except interest-only classes were "Non-Performing and Re-Performing Loan Securitizations Methodology" published in July 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/rmc-documents/390474 and "US RMBS Surveillance Methodology" published in July 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/rmc-documents/390485. The methodologies used in rating interest-only classes were "Non-Performing and Re-Performing Loan Securitizations Methodology" published in July 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/rmc-documents/390474, "US RMBS Surveillance Methodology" published in July 2022 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/rmc-documents/390485, and "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities" published in February 2019 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/rmc-documents/59126. Please see the list of ratings at the top of this announcement to identify which classes are interest-only (indicated by the *). Alternatively, please see the Rating Methodologies page on https://ratings.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.
Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the ratings:
Up
Levels of credit protection that are higher than necessary to protect investors against current expectations of loss could drive the ratings of the subordinate bonds up. Losses could decline from Moody's original expectations as a result of a lower number of obligor defaults or appreciation in the value of the mortgaged property securing an obligor's promise of payment. Transaction performance also depends greatly on the US macro economy and housing market.
Down
Levels of credit protection that are insufficient to protect investors against current expectations of loss could drive the ratings down. Losses could rise above Moody's expectations as a result of a higher number of obligor defaults or deterioration in the value of the mortgaged property securing an obligor's promise of payment. Transaction performance also depends greatly on the US macro economy and housing market. Other reasons for worse-than-expected performance include poor servicing, error on the part of transaction parties, inadequate transaction governance and fraud.
Finally, performance of RMBS continues to remain highly dependent on servicer procedures. Any change resulting from servicing transfers or other policy or regulatory change can impact the performance of these transactions. In addition, improvements in reporting formats and data availability across deals and trustees may provide better insight into certain performance metrics such as the level of collateral modifications.
An IO bond may be upgraded or downgraded, within the constraints and provisions of the IO methodology, based on lower or higher realized and expected loss due to an overall improvement or decline in the credit quality of the reference bonds and/or pools.
