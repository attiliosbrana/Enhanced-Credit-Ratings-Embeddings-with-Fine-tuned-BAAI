Moody's changes Cimpress rating outlook to positive, affirms credit ratings
Approximately $1.9 billion in rated debt securities affected
New York, August 09, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) today affirmed all credit ratings of Cimpress plc (Cimpress) and its subsidiary, Cimpress USA Incorporated, including Cimpress' B2 corporate family rating (CFR). The rating outlooks at Cimpress and Cimpress USA Incorporated were changed to positive from negative. The company's speculative grade liquidity (SGL) rating is unchanged at SGL-1 reflecting very good liquidity.
The revision of the outlook to positive from negative reflects the strong and better-than-expected recovery in Cimpress' operating performance in fiscal 2023 and Moody's expectation of further improvement in free cash flow and leverage reduction. Moody's expects free cash flow to rebound to roughly $175 - $190 million in fiscal 2024 from $19 million in fiscal 2023, driven by at least 6% organic revenue growth, working capital improvements, exit from some unprofitable markets and an incremental $76 million in cost savings that have already been implemented. Moody's projects Debt/EBITDA (Moody's adjusted) to continue to improve to 4.5x by the end of fiscal 2024, down from 5.3x and 7x at the end of fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.

RATINGS RATIONALE
Cimpress' B2 CFR reflects the company's high though improving leverage, pronounced cash flow seasonality and pressure on demand for certain of Cimpress' print marketing and consumer products across several business lines. Over a longer time-horizon, there are risks of digital substitutions for certain key products. Cimpress generates its revenue from a large number of customized orders that are not contractually recurring and its earnings are vulnerable to business and consumer sentiment in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Nevertheless, the rating garners support from the company's entrenched position and well-known brand. It also factors in the company's very good liquidity, including lack of debt maturities through 2026 and Moody's expectation of improvement in free cash flow.
The company's SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity rating reflects very good liquidity supported by a large cash balance and positive free cash flow. With about $173 million in cash and marketable securities, full availability on the $250 million revolver and projected free cash flow of around $170 - $190 million over the next 12 months, Cimpress has very good liquidity to cover an estimated $120 million in annual capex and $11.5 million in mandatory term loan amortization. Cimpress has a favorable debt maturity ladder with no funded debt coming due until June 2026 when the $600 million ($548 million outstanding at 30 June 2023) unsecured note comes due. The company's earnings and cash flows have historically been and we expect will continue to be highly seasonal. Its second fiscal quarter (ending December 31) includes most of the holiday shopping season and accounts for a disproportionately high portion of its earnings for the fiscal year, primarily due to higher sales of home and family products such as holiday cards, calendars, photo books, and personalized gifts.
Cimpress maintains a $250 million revolver due May 2026. The revolver has a springing maximum first lien net leverage ratio of 3.25x that is tested if there is any revolver drawing outstanding at the end of a quarter. Moody's does not expect Cimpress to rely on the revolver and expects the company to maintain at least a 20% cushion under the covenant requirement over the next 12 months.
Cimpress' ESG credit impact score of CIS-4 indicates the rating is lower than it would have been if ESG risk exposures did not exist. Some of the company's key products are exposed to demand disruptions from consumer shift to digital services. The company's governance risks reflect its financial policies and concentrated ownership. Cimpress expects to reduce its net leverage to below 3.25x by the end of fiscal 2024 from 3.9x currently (based on company's definition, before Moody's adjustments) and maintain leverage similar to or below the pre-pandemic levels thereafter.
The instrument level ratings reflect the probability of default of the company, as reflected in the B2-PD Probability of Default Rating, an average expected family recovery rate of 50% at default given the mix of secured and unsecured debt in the capital structure, and the particular instruments' ranking in the capital structure. The company's senior secured credit facility (revolver, USD and Euro term loans) is rated B1, one notch above the CFR, reflecting its senior ranking with respect to the $600 million senior unsecured note, which is rated Caa1.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
The ratings could be upgraded if the company sustains steady organic EBITDA growth in the mid-single digit range, Debt/EBITDA is sustained below 5x (Moody's adjusted), and the company maintains very good liquidity.
A downgrade could result if operating performance deteriorates such that Debt/EBITDA is expected to remain at 6x or above, or FCF/Debt is expected to remain in the low-single digit percent range or below, or if liquidity deteriorates.
Headquartered in Dundalk, Ireland, Cimpress plc is a provider of customized marketing products and services to small businesses and consumers worldwide, largely comprised of printed and other physical products. Revenue for the fiscal year ended June 2023 was approximately $3.1 billion.
