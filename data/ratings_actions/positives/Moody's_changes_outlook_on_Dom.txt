Moody's changes outlook on Dominican Republic's ratings to positive, affirms Ba3 ratings
New York, August 10, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has today changed the outlook on Government of Dominican Republic's ratings to positive from stable and affirmed the local and foreign-currency long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings at Ba3.
The key drivers for the outlook change to positive are:
1. Sustained high growth rates have enhanced the scale and wealth levels of the economy
2. A material decline in the government debt burden coupled with improved fiscal policy effectiveness will support medium-term debt sustainability
The affirmation of the Ba3 ratings balances the Dominican Republic's strong economic growth dynamics and relatively contained susceptibility to event risks, with a comparatively weaker fiscal position, reflecting long-standing credit challenges which include: (i) a shallow revenue base compared to peers, (ii) weak debt affordability metrics, and (iii) high exposure to foreign currency borrowing.
The local-currency ceiling remains unchanged at Baa3, set three notches above the sovereign rating. The Baa3 local currency ceiling reflects a moderate government footprint in the economy, average predictability and reliability of institutions, overall low political risk and relatively contained external imbalances. The economy is also diversified for an island nation, helping to limit its reliance on a single common revenue source.
The foreign-currency ceiling remains unchanged at Ba1, one notch below the local-currency ceiling to reflect the economy's moderate level of external indebtedness, open capital account and historically lower overall policy effectiveness.

SUSTAINED HIGH GROWTH RATES HAVE ENHANCED THE SCALE AND WEALTH LEVELS OF THE ECONOMY
The Dominican Republic had a track record of high growth rates averaging 5.6% annual real GDP growth from 2010-2019 prior to the pandemic.  The economy rebounded very strongly from the pandemic with 12.3% growth in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022, supported by effective health and fiscal policy responses and an upward shift in the investment ratio, which increased substantially to 33% of GDP in 2022 from an average of 25% in 2017-19. Ongoing development of the tourism sector, which has expanded into higher-end offerings and more international markets, has contributed significantly to growth in recent years. Moody's projects real GDP growth to moderate to around 4.3% in 2023,but expects a rebound to 5% from 2024 onward, in line with the country's economic growth potential.
Persistent high growth rates have contributed to the expansion of the economy's scale and wealth levels. Nominal GDP increased to $114 billion in 2022 from $79 billion in 2020, well above the Ba3-rated peer median of $75 billion. Meanwhile, GDP per capita increased to $24,135 (on a PPP basis) in 2022 from $18,642 in 2020, also well above the Ba3-rated peer median of $13,715.  While the scale of the economy is comparatively small on a global level, it is the largest in the Caribbean and is relatively well diversified for an island economy with significant contributions coming from the manufacturing, construction, services and agriculture sectors.
A MATERIAL DECLINE IN THE GOVERNMENT DEBT BURDEN COUPLED WITH IMPROVED FISCAL POLICY EFFECTIVENESS WILL SUPPORT MEDIUM-TERM DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Improved fiscal dynamics have reduced the general government debt burden to nearly 46% of GDP in 2022 from a high of about 57% in 2020, driven by a narrowing of the general government fiscal deficit to 3.4% of GDP in 2022 from 8.3% in 2020 and high nominal GDP growth . Looking ahead, Moody's expects debt to stabilize around current levels and fiscal deficits to narrow to 3.0% next year and around 2.5% over the longer term.
Overall government effectiveness has improved in recent years contributing to the country's strong recovery from the pandemic, improved  fiscal performance and declining inflation. Fiscal policy effectiveness has increased, as evidenced by the authorities' use of counter-cyclical policies to support growth during the pandemic and subsequent fiscal consolidation efforts which have led to a material reduction of the government deficit . At the same time, monetary policy management and macroeconomic policies have been effective in reducing inflation and containing balance-of-payments risks.
Moody's expects the government to finalize passage of legislation, which received approval by one of two chambers of congress this month, , to establish a medium-term fiscal framework that will incorporate a fiscal rule that limits primary expenditure growth and, according to the authorities, will ensure public debt is set on a declining path approaching 40% of GDP by 2035. The new fiscal framework, combined with ongoing debt management strategies focused on reducing the overall cost of sovereign debt and prospects of increased government revenue once a tax reform is adopted, could further enhance fiscal strength.
RATIONALE FOR AFFIRMATION OF Ba3 RATINGS
The affirmation of the Ba3 ratings balances the Dominican Republic's robust growth and contained government liquidity and external risks with comparatively weak fiscal and institutional strength relative to peers. Despite improving fiscal policy effectiveness, the country's fiscal strength remains a key constraint on the sovereign rating.
Debt affordability is weak in absolute and relative terms with interest payments representing nearly 19% of government revenue in 2022, almost twice the median of Ba3-rated peers. The latter is largely a reflection  of the Dominican Republic's low general government revenue which at around 15% of GDP in 2022, is well below the median of about 25% for Ba-rated peers. In addition, a 70% share of foreign currency-denominated sovereign debt implies the government's balance sheet is somewhat exposed to exchange rate shocks.
Government liquidity risk as well as balance-of-payments risks are contained. Outstanding government debt has a relatively long average maturity of around 11 years and almost 90%is fixed-rate debt. The Dominican Republic consistently runs current account deficits, but Moody's expects they will continue to be financed largely by FDI inflows, which have been in the order of 3.5% of GDP annually. International reserves reached an all-time high of around $16 billion in June 2023, supported by strong foreign exchange inflows coming from tourism activity, steady family remittances and rising FDI. The country's External Vulnerability Indicator (EVI) -- ratio of external liabilities due within one year relative to foreign exchange reserves --  is relatively low standing at about 40%.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, GOVERNANCE CONSIDERATIONS
Dominican Republic's ESG Credit Impact Score is highly negative (CIS-4), reflecting high exposure to environmental risk related mainly to physical climate risks.
Dominican Republic's exposure to environmental risks is highly negative (E-4), related to physical climate change and water issues. The country's geographical location in the Caribbean exposes it to natural disasters from hurricanes. Lower crop yields because of climate events can harm the agricultural export sector and tourism revenues may be affected by rising sea levels and increased storm severity. While the large size and geography of the island help mitigate risks, the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters in recent years intensify risks.
Exposure to social risks is also moderately negative (S-3). Social considerations historically have not materially impacted Dominican Republic's credit profile, supported by a sustained period of high economic growth rates and the reduction of poverty levels, but challenges related to education, health, safety and access to basic services will pressure government finances, more so in the context of a very narrow revenue base.
The influence of governance on Dominican Republics' credit profile is moderately negative (G-3) reflecting its relatively weak, but improving, government effectiveness, budget management, rule of law, and control of corruption.
SUMMARY OF MINUTES FROM RATING COMMITTEE
GDP per capita (PPP basis, US$):  24,135 (2022)  (also known as Per Capita Income)

Gen. Gov. Financial Balance/GDP:  -3.4% (2022)  (also known as Fiscal Balance)
Current Account Balance/GDP:  -5.6% (2022)  (also known as External Balance)
External debt/GDP:  40.7% (2022)
Economic resiliency:  baa3
Default history:  At least one default event (on bonds and/or loans) has been recorded since 1983.
On 07 August 2023, a rating committee was called to discuss the rating of the Dominican Republic, Government of. The main points raised during the discussion were: The issuer's economic fundamentals, including its economic strength, have materially increased. The issuer's institutions and governance strength, have materially increased. The issuer's fiscal or financial strength, including its debt profile, has materially increased. The issuer's susceptibility to event risks has not materially changed.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
The rating could be upgraded if fiscal metrics continue to improve and the government implements policy measures that further strengthen medium-term debt sustainability. In particular, increased debt affordability supported by higher government revenue on the back of broad-based tax reforms, and measures that materially reduce the share of foreign currency-denominated government debt, would strengthen the country's fiscal position and overall sovereign credit profile.
The outlook would likely be returned to stable if growth performance and fiscal policy outcomes prove to not be  in line with Moody's expectations. The rating would face downward pressure if the authorities deviated significantly from their current medium-term fiscal consolidation plans, resulting in a material increase in the public debt ratio. A weakening of external accounts that results in an upward structural shift in the current account deficit and a sustained decrease in foreign-exchange reserves would also exert downward pressure on the sovereign credit profile.
