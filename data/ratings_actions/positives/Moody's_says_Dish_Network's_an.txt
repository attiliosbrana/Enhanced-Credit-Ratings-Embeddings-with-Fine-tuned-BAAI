Moody's says Dish Network's announced merger with EchoStar is credit positive for Dish
New York, August 09, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) says Dish Network Corporation's (Dish) announced merger with EchoStar Corporation (EchoStar) is credit positive for Dish due to the incremental liquidity benefit given EchoStar's $1.9 billion cash and marketable securities balance as of June 30, 2023, and Dish's near-term 2024 debt maturities. However, Moody's does not believe the benefits are sufficiently material to positively impact the current Caa1 corporate family rating at Dish or at its wholly owned subsidiary, Dish DBS Corporation (DBS). The merger increases visibility into liquidity availability over the next 18 months which reduces the likelihood for potential distressed debt exchanges given Dish's continued elevated debt and weak debt prices. The merger will also moderately benefit Dish given our expectations for improvement initially in free cash flow for the combined entity, and moderate future synergy benefits to mitigate some of DBS negative and accelerating subscriber loss trends and wireless negative cash flow.
Dish and EchoStar announced they have entered into a definitive agreement for them to combine in an all-stock merger. The companies expect to combine Dish's satellite technology, streaming services and nationwide 5G network with EchoStar's satellite communications solutions, creating a global leader in terrestrial and non-terrestrial wireless connectivity. Dish's 5G wireless network now covers more than 70 percent of the US with full commercialization slowly beginning and underway. The successful launch of EchoStar's Jupiter 3 satellite will provide significant available capacity for converged terrestrial and non-terrestrial services. The combined company expects to deliver a broad set of communication and content distribution capabilities, accelerating the delivery of satellite and wireless connectivity solutions. The transaction is expected to be completed by year-end 2023.
