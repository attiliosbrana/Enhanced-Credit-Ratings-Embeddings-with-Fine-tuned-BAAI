New York, August 31, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") today changed Bloomin' Brands, Inc.'s ("Bloomin' Brands") outlook to positive from stable. At the same time, Moody's affirmed Bloomin' Brands' ratings, including its Ba3 corporate family rating (CFR), Ba3-PD probability of default rating (PDR), Ba1 on its senior secured revolving credit facility, and B1 on its senior unsecured global notes. The speculative grade liquidity rating (SGL) remains unchanged at SGL-1.
The change in outlook to positive reflects Bloomin' Brands' sustained improvement in operating performance despite challenging industry conditions, including ongoing inflationary pressure and negative customer traffic.

RATINGS RATIONALE
Bloomin' Brands' Ba3 CFR benefits from the high level of brand awareness of its four brands, a greater focus on off-premises, To-Go, and third-party delivery services and large and diversified asset base with 1,475 restaurants spread across the US and about 22% located internationally. Improved operating performance, including continued revenue growth with solid profit margins along with positive free cash flow and debt reduction, have resulted in stronger credit metrics. Moody's lease adjusted debt/EBITDA improved to around 3.0x for the twelve months ended June 25, 2023, down from 3.3x at the fiscal year ended 2022. EBIT/interest improved to around 2.8x from 2.6x over the same period. Liquidity remains very good supported by balance sheet cash, positive free cash flow and ample excess revolver availability. Bloomin' Brands' credit profile is constrained by the risks to its operating profits and margins over the near term presented by continued cost inflation in certain operating expenses coupled with increasing macroeconomic pressure that could temper consumer spending on food away from home. Bloomin' Brands' sizeable concentration of sales within the casual steak category also increases vulnerability to consumer spending patterns within the category.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS
Ratings could be upgraded should the company continue to demonstrate the ability to navigate the challenging cost and consumer spending environment while maintaining customer traffic and solid credit metrics, including Moody's debt to EBITDA sustained below 4.0 times and EBIT coverage of interest of over 2.75 times. A higher rating would also require maintaining at least good liquidity and a balanced financial policy.
Ratings could be downgraded if operating performance, liquidity or credit metrics materially weakened such that Moody's debt to EBITDA exceeded 4.75 times or EBIT coverage of interest fell below 2.0 times on a sustained basis.  In addition, in the event the company's convertible notes are converted or repaid, the loss of junior support in the capital structure could result in a downgrade of the senior secured revolving credit facility and/or senior unsecured notes.
Bloomin' Brands, Inc. owns and operates a diversified base of casual dining concepts which include Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill, and Fleming's Prime Steakhouse and Wine Bar. Revenue exceeded $4.5 billion for the latest twelve month period ended June 25, 2023.
