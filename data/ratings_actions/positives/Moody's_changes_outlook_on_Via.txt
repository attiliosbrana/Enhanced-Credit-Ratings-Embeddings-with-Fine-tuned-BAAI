Moody's changes outlook on Via A11 to positive; affirms A2 rating
London, August 24, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has today changed the outlook to positive from stable on Via A11 N.V. ("Via A11" or "ProjectCo"), which operates and maintains the 13 kilometer A11 Brugge motorway in Belgium, connecting the N49 to the northeast with the N31 to the southwest of the project road. Concurrently, Moody's has affirmed the A2 rating of Via A11's senior secured bonds due 2045.
RATINGS RATIONALE
Today's rating action reflects the ProjectCo's strong operational performance since the motorway's construction completion in September 2017, with a full receipt of availability payments and minimal performance and availability deductions. Continued good operating and financial performance, including average debt service coverage ratios (DSCRs) in the range of 1.2x-1.3x, could leave its credit profile commensurate with a higher rating level.
The ProjectCo's credit quality also benefits from support under the European Investment Bank Project Bond Credit Enhancement (EIB PBCE) scheme. The EIB PBCE, sized at 10% of outstanding senior bonds acts as a form of first-loss absorption during a default scenario and provides additional liquidity support on a subordinated basis to senior debt. The PBCE can be used (a) for debt service shortfall during operations; (b) during a period of accelerated payments; or (c) as a means to pre-pay debt principal under certain circumstances.
Via A11's rating is underpinned by a standard availability-payment PPP under a 30-year operating concession through 2047 with no exposure to traffic risk. Average and minimum  DSCRs are 1.25x and 1.15x based on Moody's methodology. With the exception of some complexity related to the operation and maintenance  of two hydraulic jack-operated bascule bridges, the ProjectCo's requirements consist of standard services of re-paving, lighting, lane marking, clearing of debris and maintaining lane usage in line with operating parameters outlined in the concession agreement.
Given the limited operating requirements, the all-cost break-even at 38% is towards the stronger end among peers, albeit the metric has decreased since the start of operations, mainly as a consequence of the difference between assumed and outturn input price inflation indices. Mitigating the cost overrun risk is that operation, maintenance and lifecycle are fully sub-contracted, and there is a broad matching of the proportion of indexed revenue with indexed costs. The off-taker is the Community of Flanders (Aa3, stable), which is through PMV N.V. also a financial partner in the ProjectCo along with many members of the original construction consortium creating a strong alignment of interests.
FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATING
The rating could be upgraded if the ProjectCo continued to demonstrate (1) consistently robust operational performance and maintenance (including the bridges) with minimal deductions; (2) a smooth relationship between the project parties; (3) an average DSCR at least in the range of 1.2-1.3x; and (4) an ample maintenance funding.
Conversely, Moody's could downgrade the rating in case of (1) availability deductions approaching 50 points in one quarter or 80 points across two quarters, leading to issuance of warning notices; (2) a weak financial performance with DSCRs around the lock-up level on a sustained basis; or (3) a material deterioration in Moody's assessment of the off-taker's credit quality.
The principal methodology used in this rating was Operational Privately Financed Public Infrastructure (PFI/PPP/P3) Projects published in March 2023 and available at https://ratings.moodys.com/rmc-documents/400755.

Via A11 N.V.  is 61% owned by Via Brugge NV and 39% by PMV NV (an investment company owned by the Community of Flanders). Maintenance is provided by a consortium of initial EPC contractors made up of predominantly Jan De Nul NV (45%) and several other construction companies active in the Benelux region.
